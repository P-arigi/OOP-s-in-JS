Prototype Intro
Every single function that is created in JavaScript has a prototype property. Moreover, each object
 that is created can access its constructor's prototype property via the object's own __proto__ property.

Let's start by looking at Object.prototype. In the Chrome console, try typing Object.prototype then
 expand the object you get back. You can see that Object already has many properties on its prototype.
