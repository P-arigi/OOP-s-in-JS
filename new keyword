What does the new keyword do?
When new is used, the following happens:

An empty object is created,
The keyword this inside of the constructor function refers to the empty object that was just created,
A return this is added to the constructor function (this is why you don't need to explicitly return any value),
An internal link is created between the object and the .prototype property on the constructor function. We can actually access this link on the object that is created: it is called __proto__, sometimes pronounced "dunder" (double underscore) proto.
